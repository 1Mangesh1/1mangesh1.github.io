There's something magical about the terminal. No fancy graphics, no distracting UI elements - just you and the machine, communicating through text.

## It's Fast

No loading spinners. No waiting for the UI to render. Type a command, get a result. The feedback loop is instant.

## It's Composable

Pipe one command into another. Chain tools together. Build complex workflows from simple primitives. Unix philosophy at its finest.

## It's Honest

When something breaks, the terminal tells you exactly what went wrong. No "Something went wrong, please try again later." Just raw error messages and stack traces.

## It Makes You Feel Like a Hacker

Let's be honest - there's a certain satisfaction in watching text scroll by while you're getting work done. It never gets old.
