I spent three days refactoring code that was already working. Moved files around. Renamed variables. Created abstractions for things that didn't need abstracting.

The feature still isn't shipped.

Meanwhile, a colleague pushed a "quick and dirty" solution that solved the actual business problem. Users are happy. It works.

Will they refactor it later? Maybe. But the important thing is: it's *out there*, providing value.

Shipping beats polish. Every time.

That doesn't mean write bad code. It means:
- Ship the 80% solution
- Get feedback from real users
- Iterate based on reality, not imagination

The code you're embarrassed by but is running in production > the perfect code sitting in your local branch.
