I am unreasonably passionate about keyboard shortcuts. Every time I watch someone reach for the mouse to do something I know has a shortcut, a small part of me dies. Here are the shortcuts that genuinely transformed my workflow.

## VS Code

- **`Cmd+Shift+P`** — The command palette. If you know nothing else, know this. It's the gateway to everything.
- **`Cmd+P`** — Quick file open. Fuzzy search across your entire project. Never touch the sidebar file tree again.
- **`Cmd+D`** — Select next occurrence. Multi-cursor editing that feels like a superpower.
- **`Cmd+Shift+K`** — Delete entire line. No selecting, no backspace mashing.
- **`Cmd+K Cmd+S`** — Open keyboard shortcuts. Shortcut-ception.
- **`Alt+Up/Down`** — Move line up/down. Rearranging code without copy-paste.
- **`Cmd+/`** — Toggle comment. Works in every language.

## Terminal

- **`Ctrl+R`** — Reverse search history. Stop retyping long commands.
- **`Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+E`** — Jump to start/end of line. Essential for editing long commands.
- **`!!`** — Repeat last command. `sudo !!` is life-changing.
- **`Ctrl+K`** — Kill to end of line. Faster than holding delete.

## macOS

- **`Cmd+Space`** — Spotlight. Launch anything, calculate anything, find anything.
- **`Cmd+Tab`** — App switcher. But hold `Cmd` and press `~` to switch windows within an app.
- **`Ctrl+Left/Right`** — Switch desktops. Once you use multiple desktops, you never go back.
- **`Cmd+Shift+4` then `Space`** — Screenshot a specific window with a nice shadow. Chef's kiss.

## Browser

- **`Cmd+L`** — Focus address bar. Instant navigation.
- **`Cmd+Shift+T`** — Reopen closed tab. The undo button for accidental closes.
- **`Cmd+Option+I`** — Open DevTools. Because `F12` requires finding the `Fn` key on a Mac.

The compound effect of saving 2 seconds per action, thousands of times a day, is *hours* of your life back. Learn your shortcuts. Your future self will thank you.
