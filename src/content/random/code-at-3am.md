I woke up, checked the git log, and braced for disaster. The commit message read: *"refactored auth flow, trust me."* Classic 3 AM energy. But when I actually read the diff... it was clean. Really clean. Cleaner than anything I'd written during business hours that week.

## The Inner Critic Goes to Sleep

During the day, I second-guess every abstraction. "Should this be a hook or a utility? What if the requirements change? Let me read three blog posts about this pattern first." At 3 AM, that voice shuts up. You just *write*. The solution flows because you're too tired to overthink it.

## Flow State Hits Different

There's something about the silence, the darkness, the complete absence of Slack notifications. Your brain enters a tunnel where the only thing that exists is the problem and the code. No stand-ups in 30 minutes. No "quick sync" ambushing your calendar. Just you and the compiler.

## The Catch

I'm not advocating for sleep deprivation as a productivity strategy. That's terrible advice and unsustainable. But I *am* saying that some of my most elegant solutions came when I stopped trying to write elegant solutions. When exhaustion stripped away the performance anxiety and left only instinct.

Sometimes your best work happens when you get out of your own way. Even if "getting out of your own way" means being too tired to get in it.
