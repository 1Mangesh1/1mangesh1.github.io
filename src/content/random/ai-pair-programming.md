Everyone's talking about AI replacing developers. Here's how I actually use it:

## What Works

- **Rubber ducking**: Explain my problem, get it reflected back differently
- **Boilerplate generation**: Tests, types, documentation
- **API exploration**: "How do I do X with this library?"
- **Code review**: "What edge cases am I missing?"
- **Refactoring suggestions**: Alternative approaches I hadn't considered

## What Doesn't Work

- Architecture decisions (lacks context)
- Business logic (doesn't understand the domain)
- Debugging complex issues (hallucinations make it worse)
- Writing code I don't understand

## The Real Skill

Knowing when to use it and when to think harder yourself.

AI amplifies your abilities. If you don't understand the fundamentals, it amplifies your confusion.
