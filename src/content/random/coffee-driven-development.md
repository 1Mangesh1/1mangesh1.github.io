I've noticed a pattern in my git commits:

```
09:00 - "Initial commit" (pre-coffee)
09:30 - "Add feature X" (first cup)
10:00 - "Refactor feature X" (second cup)
10:30 - "Actually refactor feature X properly" (third cup)
11:00 - "Add comprehensive test coverage" (peak caffeine)
14:00 - "Fix typo" (post-lunch crash)
15:00 - "Revert 'Actually refactor feature X properly'" (existential doubt)
16:00 - "Fix: previous fix was wrong" (desperation)
17:00 - "WIP: going home" (acceptance)
```

The optimal blood caffeine level for coding appears to be somewhere between "can see sound" and "questioning life choices."

Further research needed. For science.
