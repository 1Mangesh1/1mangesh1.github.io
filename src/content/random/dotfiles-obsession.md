Instead of working on my actual project, I:

1. Rewrote my `.zshrc` from scratch
2. Added 47 new aliases I'll never remember
3. Configured Neovim (again)
4. Made my terminal prompt *just right*
5. Set up a new color scheme
6. Wrote a script to sync everything to GitHub
7. Added a fancy README with screenshots

Time spent: 6 hours
Productivity gained: Maybe 30 seconds per day?
Satisfaction: Immeasurable

## Was It Worth It?

**Objectively**: No. The ROI is terrible.

**Emotionally**: Absolutely. My terminal looks *beautiful* and I understand every line of config.

There's value in understanding your tools deeply. Even if the "productivity gains" are mostly imaginary.

Plus, now I can answer Stack Overflow questions about zsh configuration.

That's worth something, right?

*Right?*
