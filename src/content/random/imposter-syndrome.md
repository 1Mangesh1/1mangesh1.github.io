Went to a tech conference. Immediately felt like a fraud.

Everyone's talking about distributed systems, machine learning pipelines, and infrastructure at scale. I'm over here proud that I finally understood how `this` works in JavaScript.

Then I talked to someone. Turns out:

- The ML expert doesn't understand CSS
- The infrastructure wizard can't center a div
- The distributed systems architect forgot how REST works
- The senior architect googles "how to exit vim" weekly

**Nobody knows everything.**

We're all just people who got really good at specific things and are fumbling through the rest.

The trick isn't knowing everything. It's:
1. Knowing what you don't know
2. Knowing how to find out
3. Being honest about both

Still felt like an imposter at the after-party though. Baby steps.
