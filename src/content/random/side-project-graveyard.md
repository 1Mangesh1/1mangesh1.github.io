Here lie the projects I started and never finished:

## The Fallen

- **TodoApp v47** - Because the world needed another one
- **MyBlog (2022)** - 3 commits, 0 posts
- **CryptoTracker** - Died 
- **FitnessApp** - Lasted longer than my gym membership
- **AmazingIdea™** - README.md only
- **CloneOfPopularApp** - "For learning purposes"
- **AI-Powered-Everything** - Ahead of its time (I tell myself)

## Lessons Learned

Each dead project taught me something:
- How to set up a project from scratch
- A new framework or library
- That I need to validate ideas before coding
- That finishing is harder than starting

## The One That Lived

This website. Still breathing. Still getting commits.

Maybe the secret is building something you actually use.
