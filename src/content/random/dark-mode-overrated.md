I'm going to say it: **dark mode is overrated.** There, I said it. Cancel me.

Somewhere around 2019, dark mode stopped being a preference and became a personality trait. "Oh, you use light mode? Do you also enjoy staring directly into the sun?" Very funny. But here's the thing — I switched back to light mode six months ago and I genuinely read faster, focus better, and get fewer headaches.

## The Science Bit

Research consistently shows that dark text on a light background is more readable for most people in well-lit environments. Our pupils constrict with light backgrounds, resulting in sharper depth of field. Dark mode is essentially asking your eyes to dilate constantly — which works at night, sure, but not at 2 PM in a sunlit office.

## The OLED Argument

"But battery life!" Yes, OLED screens save power with dark pixels. On your *phone*. Your MacBook, your external monitor, your office display? All LCD. Dark mode saves exactly zero battery there.

## Dark Mode Fatigue

After months in permanent dark mode, I noticed eye strain I'd attributed to screen time was actually from low-contrast dark themes. Switching back felt like putting on glasses for the first time.

The real hot take? **Use whatever works for your environment.** Auto-switching based on ambient light is the actual correct answer. But that's not controversial enough for Twitter, is it?

Stop making your IDE theme a moral stance. Ship code instead.
