A comprehensive collection of resources for learning system design — whether you're preparing for interviews or architecting production systems.

## The Essentials

- **[System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)** — The single best free resource. Covers everything from load balancing to database sharding with diagrams and trade-off analysis. Star this repo immediately.
- **[ByteByteGo](https://bytebytego.com/)** by Alex Xu — Visual explanations of system design concepts. His *System Design Interview* books (Vol 1 & 2) are the most recommended resources in the space.

## Books

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann — The bible of distributed systems. Dense, rigorous, and incredibly valuable. Not interview-specific but gives you a depth of understanding that interviewers can sense.
- **System Design Interview** (Vol 1 & 2) by Alex Xu — Step-by-step walkthroughs of designing 20+ real systems. The closest thing to a cheat code for system design interviews.

## YouTube Channels

- **[Gaurav Sen](https://www.youtube.com/c/GauravSensei)** — Clear, visual explanations of system design concepts. Great for building intuition.
- **[Martin Kleppmann's Talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=martin+kleppmann)** — Academic rigor meets practical engineering. His talks on distributed systems are essential viewing.
- **[Hussein Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering)** — Deep dives into networking, databases, and backend architecture.

## Practice

- **[DesignGurus.io](https://www.designgurus.io/)** — Structured system design courses with practice problems.
- **[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)** — Free whiteboard tool perfect for sketching system design diagrams during practice (and real interviews).

## Key Topics to Master

Load balancing, caching strategies, database partitioning, CAP theorem, message queues, microservices vs monoliths, API design, rate limiting, and consistent hashing. Start with the primer and branch out from there.
