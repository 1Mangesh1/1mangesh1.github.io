A structured learning path for software developers who want to get into AI and machine learning without going back to school. Practical, project-focused, and sorted by where to start.

## Start Here

- **[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)** — The best way to start. Jeremy Howard's "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" teaches top-down: start building models immediately, then learn the theory behind them. Free, excellent, and designed for programmers.
- **[Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)** — The classic. Updated for 2024 with Python (replacing the old Matlab/Octave version). Covers fundamentals of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks.

## Go Deeper

- **[Andrej Karpathy's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrejKarpathy)** — Former Tesla AI Director building neural networks from scratch on YouTube. His "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series is exceptional — you build GPT from the ground up.
- **[Hugging Face Tutorials](https://huggingface.co/learn)** — Hands-on courses for NLP, transformers, and diffusion models. The Hugging Face ecosystem is where most practical AI work happens today, so learning their tools is essential.

## Papers & Research

- **[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)** — Every ML paper linked to its implementation. Browse state-of-the-art results by task, find the paper, and read the code. The best bridge between academic research and practical engineering.
- **[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)** — Beautiful, interactive explanations of ML concepts. Not actively publishing new content, but the archive is gold.

## Math (Only What You Need)

- **[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)** — Visual, intuitive explanations of linear algebra and calculus. His "Essence of Linear Algebra" series makes matrix operations click.
- **[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)** — Free textbook covering the math foundations. Dip into chapters as needed rather than reading cover to cover.

## Build Projects

The fastest way to learn is to build. Start with: image classification (fast.ai lesson 1), sentiment analysis (Hugging Face), a chatbot (OpenAI API + RAG), and a recommendation engine. Ship something to production — deploying a model teaches you more than any course.
