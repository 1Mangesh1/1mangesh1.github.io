Visual Studio Code is my go-to editor for all development work. With the right extensions, it becomes incredibly powerful for Python, JavaScript, and web development.

## Key Extensions

- Python
- Prettier
- ESLint
- GitLens
- Thunder Client
- Live Server

## Tips

1. Use the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) for everything
2. Set up custom keybindings for common tasks
3. Learn Emmet shortcuts for HTML/CSS
4. Use integrated terminal effectively
