A handbook of agile software craftsmanship. While some examples feel dated (Java-heavy), the principles are timeless.

## Key Takeaways

- **Meaningful Names**: Variables should reveal intent
- **Small Functions**: Do one thing and do it well
- **Comments**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions, not return codes
- **Testing**: Clean tests are as important as clean code
