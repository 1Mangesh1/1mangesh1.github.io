The classic that gave refactoring its name and rigor. Fowler's catalog of refactorings is timeless — Extract Function, Move Field, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism — these patterns come up in every codebase I touch.

What I appreciate most about the second edition is the JavaScript examples, making it more accessible to modern web developers. The core message remains: refactoring isn't about rewriting, it's about making small, safe, behavior-preserving transformations that improve code structure over time. The emphasis on testing as a safety net for refactoring is something every developer needs to internalize.
