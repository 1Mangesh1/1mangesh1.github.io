The most practical book on habit formation I've read. Changed how I approach personal and professional growth.

## The 4 Laws of Behavior Change

1. **Make it Obvious** - Design your environment
2. **Make it Attractive** - Bundle habits you need with habits you want
3. **Make it Easy** - Reduce friction, start small
4. **Make it Satisfying** - Immediate rewards reinforce behavior

## What I Applied

- **Habit Stacking**: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write for 10 minutes"
- **Environment Design**: Put my phone in another room while working
- **2-Minute Rule**: Start with tiny habits that take less than 2 minutes

## Results

Actually stuck with habits for the first time. The compound effect is real.
