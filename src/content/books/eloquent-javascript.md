The book that taught me JavaScript properly. Free online, but worth buying physical.

## What Makes It Special

- Exercises that actually challenge you
- Deep explanations of closures, prototypes, and async
- Projects: a robot, a programming language, a pixel editor
- Beautiful writing that makes concepts stick

## Best Chapters

- **The Secret Life of Objects**: Finally understood prototypes
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Best explanation of promises
- **Node.js**: Good intro to server-side JS

## Recommendation

Read it even if you "know" JavaScript. You'll discover gaps in your understanding.
