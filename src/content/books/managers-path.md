Currently reading through this guide on the journey from individual contributor to engineering management. Fournier lays out the path from mentoring, to tech lead, to managing a team, to managing managers — each stage with its own unique challenges.

Notes so far:
- The transition from IC to tech lead is less about coding more and more about enabling others to code well.
- Managing your manager is an underrated skill — understanding their priorities and communicating in their language.
- One-on-ones are your most important tool as a manager, and most people do them wrong.

Will update this review once I finish the book.
