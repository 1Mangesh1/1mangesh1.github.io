A novel about DevOps transformation that reads like a thriller set inside an IT department. Following Bill Palmer as he's thrust into the role of VP of IT Operations at Parts Unlimited, you watch him discover the Three Ways of DevOps through trial, error, and mentorship.

What makes this book special is that it doesn't just teach DevOps principles — it makes you *feel* the pain of broken deployments, siloed teams, and unplanned work. It completely changed my perspective on IT operations and how development and ops need to work together. The parallels to manufacturing (Theory of Constraints) clicked in a way that no technical whitepaper ever could.
