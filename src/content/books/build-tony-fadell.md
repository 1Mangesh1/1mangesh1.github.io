On my reading list because Tony Fadell — the creator of the iPod and co-creator of the iPhone — has a unique vantage point on building products that actually matter. The book covers everything from career advice to product design to company building, drawing from his experiences at Apple and Nest.

I'm especially interested in his takes on the intersection of hardware and software design, and how to build products that solve real problems rather than chasing features.
