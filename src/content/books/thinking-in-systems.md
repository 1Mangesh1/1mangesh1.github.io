This book fundamentally changed how I approach software architecture and debugging. Meadows introduces systems thinking through accessible examples — bathtubs, thermostats, economies — and builds up to powerful concepts like feedback loops, leverage points, and emergent behavior.

How systems thinking applies to software:
- **Feedback loops** are everywhere: monitoring → alerting → response is a balancing loop. Technical debt → slower velocity → more shortcuts is a reinforcing loop.
- **Stocks and flows** map perfectly to queues, buffers, and caches in distributed systems.
- **Leverage points** help you find where a small change produces the biggest impact — exactly what you need when debugging complex systems.
- **Bounded rationality** explains why teams make locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions.

A short, profound book that gives you mental models applicable far beyond software.
