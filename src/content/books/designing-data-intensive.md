The definitive guide to data systems. Dense but incredibly rewarding. I refer back to it constantly.

## What It Covers

- **Data Models**: Relational vs Document vs Graph
- **Storage Engines**: How databases actually work
- **Replication**: Single-leader, multi-leader, leaderless
- **Partitioning**: Strategies for scaling horizontally
- **Transactions**: ACID, isolation levels, distributed transactions
- **Consensus**: Paxos, Raft, and their applications

## Why It's Essential

Finally understood *why* certain database choices are made, not just *how* to use them. The mental models are invaluable for system design interviews.

## Reading Tip

Don't rush it. Take notes. Each chapter deserves multiple readings.
