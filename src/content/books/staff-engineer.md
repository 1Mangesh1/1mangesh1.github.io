Currently reading this guide to technical leadership beyond the senior level.

## Why I'm Reading It

Hit a ceiling in my career growth. Want to understand what it means to have impact at scale without becoming a manager.

## Early Impressions

The four archetypes of Staff Engineers are eye-opening:
- **Tech Lead**: Guides a team's technical direction
- **Architect**: Responsible for system design across teams
- **Solver**: Deep expertise in specific domains
- **Right Hand**: Partners with leadership on strategic projects

Looking forward to the sections on sponsorship and building a personal brand.
