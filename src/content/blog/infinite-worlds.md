Imagine a game where every time you log in, the world feels fresh, uncharted, and limitless. Procedural generation is the magic behind these ever-expanding, dynamic environments. Games like Minecraft revolutionized the idea of endless exploration, crafting an infinite sandbox with complex landscapes, resources, and creaturesâ€”all created through algorithms rather than meticulous design.

In this post, we'll dive deep into the fascinating world of procedural generation. We'll walk through how developers use this technique to generate vast terrains, random quests, and unique objects, keeping gameplay fresh with each session. By the end, you'll even learn how to implement a simple terrain generator yourself! But first, let's look at the games that brought procedural generation into the spotlight.

## Games That Embrace Procedural Generation

### 1. **Minecraft**

Minecraft is the poster child for procedural generation, creating vast, blocky worlds filled with resources, creatures, and dungeons. Each new world is generated based on a seed value, ensuring that players can share their unique worlds with others.

### 2. **No man's Sky**

No man's Sky takes procedural generation to the stars, crafting an entire universe of planets, flora, and fauna. The game uses complex algorithms to create diverse ecosystems, ensuring that each planet feels distinct and unexplored.

and many more games are using procedural generation to create vast worlds and unique experiences for players.

Procedural generation has revolutionized how we create virtual worlds, enabling developers to craft vast, unique environments without manually designing every detail. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of procedural generation and implement a simple terrain generator.

## What is Procedural Generation?

Procedural generation refers to creating content algorithmically rather than manually. In game development, this technique can generate:

- Terrain and landscapes
- Buildings and structures
- Flora and fauna
- Quest systems
- Item variations

## The Power of Randomized Seeds

One of the most fascinating aspects of procedural generation is that complex worlds can emerge from simple mathematical functions and random seeds. The same seed will always generate identical content, allowing for:

- Reproducible worlds
- Shared experiences between players
- Efficient storage of vast environments

## Building a Simple Terrain Generator

Let's create a simple visualization of our terrain generation using HTML and TypeScript. This example will create a grid-based display where each cell's color represents different terrain heights:

```javascript
const worldWidth = 10;
const worldHeight = 10;

const terrainTypes = ["grass", "water", "mountain"];

function generateWorld(width, height) {
  const world = [];

  for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    const row = [];

    for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      const randomTerrain =
        terrainTypes[Math.floor(Math.random() * terrainTypes.length)];
      row.push(randomTerrain);
    }

    world.push(row);
  }

  return world;
}

function displayWorld(world) {
  for (let row of world) {
    console.log(row.join(" | "));
  }
}

const world = generateWorld(worldWidth, worldHeight);
displayWorld(world);
```

```text

water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water
mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain
grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass
water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water

mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain
grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass | water | mountain | grass
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- We define the `worldWidth` and `worldHeight` constants to set the dimensions of our grid.
- The `terrainTypes` array contains the different types of terrain we want to generate.
- The `
