## üîé How Google Search Index Works

Google uses bots (crawlers) to scan the web, following links and reading pages. Here‚Äôs how your site gets into Google‚Äôs index:

1. **Crawling**: Googlebot discovers your pages by following links or reading your sitemap.
2. **Indexing**: Google analyzes the content, structure, and metadata, then stores it in its massive search index.
3. **Ranking**: When someone searches, Google‚Äôs algorithms rank indexed pages based on relevance, quality, and hundreds of other factors.

> **Pro Tip:** Use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to monitor how Google sees your site, submit sitemaps, and fix indexing issues.
