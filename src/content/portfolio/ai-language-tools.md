# AI Language Tools Suite

A delightful collection of AI-powered language tools that bring humor and creativity to everyday communication. Built with Google Gemini AI and featuring a warm, beige-themed interface that makes language manipulation both fun and accessible.

## Project Overview

This suite combines the power of Google's Gemini AI with a playful approach to language, offering four distinct tools that transform how we communicate. From translating corporate jargon to converting insults into passive-aggressive compliments, each tool serves a unique purpose while maintaining a consistent, user-friendly experience.

## Tools Included

### 1. Brainrot ↔ English Translator

- **Real-time Translation**: Instant conversion with context awareness

### 2. Corporate BS Generator

Create professional-sounding buzzword phrases for any occasion:

- **Random Generation**: Produce authentic-sounding corporate speak
- **Keyword Integration**: Include specific terms in generated phrases
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains professional tone while highlighting absurdity

### 4. Polite but Brutal: Bad Review Generator

- **Subject Customization**: Specify products, apps, or services
- **Emotion Targeting**: Incorporate underlying feelings like frustration or confusion
- **Creative Formats**: Including poetic reviews in haiku form

## Technical Implementation

GET /api/corporate-bs?keywords=blockchain,metaverse
GET /api/insult-to-compliment?text=You're lazy
GET /api/bad-review?style=Passive-Aggressive&subject=app
```

### Frontend Features

- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design focusing on functionality

## Key Features

### User Experience

- **Simple Navigation**: Intuitive menu system for tool switching
- **Fast Response Times**: Optimized API calls for quick results
- **Consistent Theming**: Warm beige color palette throughout
- **Accessibility**: Clean, readable interface design

### Technical Highlights

- **Single API Key**: Efficient resource management across all tools
- **Modular Architecture**: Each tool as a separate, maintainable module
- **Environment Flexibility**: Easy deployment with environment variables
- **Development Workflow**: Hot-reload support for rapid iteration

## Example Outputs

### Insult-to-Compliment Conversions

- _"You're dumb"_ → _"You have such a unique way of thinking—like nobody else would ever think that."_
- _"Your cooking is terrible"_ → _"Your adventurous approach to flavors is certainly memorable!"_

### Bad Review Examples

  ```
  Crashed once, then again
  Took my hopes and dreams with it
  Still gave four stars
  ```
