# Expense Tracking and Budgeting API

A comprehensive expense management system built with NestJS and TypeORM, featuring robust authentication, role-based access control, and intelligent data aggregation.

## Key Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization system
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels for users and administrators
- **Data Aggregation**: Intelligent expense categorization and spending analysis
- **Scheduled Summaries**: Automated expense reports and budget notifications
- **RESTful API Design**: Clean, well-documented API endpoints
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API documentation for easy integration

## Technical Implementation

The application follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns:

- **Authentication Module**: JWT token management and user session handling
- **Expense Module**: CRUD operations for expense management
- **Budget Module**: Budget creation, tracking, and alerts
- **Reporting Module**: Data aggregation and summary generation
- **User Management**: Role-based user administration

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- **Validation**: Class-validator for input validation
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

This project demonstrates proficiency in building scalable backend systems with modern TypeScript frameworks and database design patterns.
