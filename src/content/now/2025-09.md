## What I'm up to right now

This month has been about diving deeper into real-world backend challenges—especially implementing organization-level filtering and improving auth flows using AWS Cognito. I've also been slowly iterating on my portfolio site with Astro to improve performance and design flexibility.

## Projects

- **Org-Level Filtering**: Implemented secure data access controls in Django using model managers and viewset overrides
- **Auth & Infra**: Experimenting with Cognito, Terraform, and AWS setup for tenant separation and OTP flows
- **Portfolio Rework**: Continuing to build my site in Astro, integrating more project showcases and simplifying UI/UX

## Reading

Recently started "Show Your Work" by Austin Kleon — it's been encouraging and motivating in terms of putting projects out there consistently.

## Goals for next month

1. Finalize the auth flow for the app (Cognito pools + Django integration)
2. Complete and ship the updated personal site
3. Publish 1–2 technical blog posts
4. Wrap up benchmarking docs and get more confident with Notion documentation
5. Keep refining Terraform infrastructure patterns

## Life updates

Been settling into a much more focused routine — fixed my desk/chair setup at home, and it's really helping reduce back strain.
Also enjoying deeper technical conversations with teammates and mentors — it's pushing me to think more in terms of systems and ownership.
