## What I'm up to right now

November’s been all about tightening fundamentals — both in architecture thinking and in implementation. I’ve been revisiting the **core principles behind microservices**, understanding when they add real value, and how to integrate them cleanly within an existing system.

A big focus this month is on **microservice communication and orchestration** — making services talk efficiently, while staying independent. It’s been a mix of design exploration, hands-on coding, and documenting lessons along the way.

## Projects

- **Service Integration Layer**: Building a lightweight communication layer for internal microservices with authentication, retry, and monitoring baked in.
- **System Design Practice**: Following Gaurav Sen’s playlists to deepen my understanding of real-world trade-offs and scalability bottlenecks.
- **Resume Analyzer**: Preparing to modularize the backend to separate credit usage, authentication, and template generation as independent services.
- **Architecture Docs**: Creating visual maps and internal design notes to connect system boundaries, data flow, and scalability paths.

## Reading

Currently reading _Clean Architecture_ by Robert C. Martin — refreshing the fundamentals of good design separation, maintainability, and flow. It's been a great complement to the microservices work, grounding complexity with strong architectural discipline.

## Goals for November

1. Finish implementing the microservice communication and monitoring setup  
2. Document architectural trade-offs between async and sync service calls  
3. Continue writing smaller technical notes and publish one detailed blog post  
4. Start exploring edge caching and service-level metrics  

## Life updates

This month’s been quieter but deeply focused. I’ve been spending more time designing before coding — slowing down intentionally to think through structure and maintainability.  
Also started scheduling daily “deep focus” windows — they’ve been a game changer for clarity and progress.
