## What I'm up to right now

December's been all about balance — going out, enjoying life, and learning at my own pace. Everything's going well! Been going out more and enjoying the vibes. 🌟

Taking a more relaxed approach to learning this month, focusing on understanding concepts deeply rather than rushing through material.

## Learning

- 📚 **System Design** - Diving deep into system design concepts through [Gaurav Sen (GKCS) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@gkcs). Great content for understanding distributed systems, scalability, and architecture patterns. Learning about load balancing, caching strategies, and database sharding.

- 🤖 **ML/AI Trends** - Getting started with the latest trends in Machine Learning and AI. Taking it slow and steady to truly understand the fundamentals and recent developments. Exploring:
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Transformer architectures
  - Latest open-source AI tools
  - Understanding the AI landscape in 2025

## Projects

- **Portfolio Updates**: Continuing to improve and refine the personal website with new features and better UX.
- **Learning Notes**: Documenting system design concepts as I learn them for future reference.
- **AI Exploration**: Experimenting with different AI tools and understanding their capabilities.

## Goals for December

1. Complete the system design fundamentals playlist
2. Build a solid understanding of at least 3-4 major ML/AI trends
3. Take time to relax and recharge for the new year
4. Maybe start planning a new project for 2026

## Life updates

Chilling for now. ❄️ Taking it easy and enjoying the learning journey without rushing. Sometimes the best progress comes from a relaxed mindset.

This month's been about finding the right balance — being productive while also taking time to enjoy life. Going out more, meeting people, and just living in the moment.
