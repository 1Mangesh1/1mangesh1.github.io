- Developer tools (QR Generator, Password Generator, JSON Formatter)
- Easter eggs and fun surprises
- Dark mode, reading progress bar, and smooth animations

### Resume Analyzer
Experimented with the **Google Gemini API** to build a resume analyzer that parses resumes, matches against job descriptions, and generates feedback. Explored auth, credits system, and LaTeX-based resume generation.

### Work Projects
- Built RESTful APIs for mobile applications
- Implemented organization-level filtering in Django
- Worked on AWS Cognito authentication flows
- Explored Terraform for infrastructure management
- Designed tenant-aware microservice architectures
