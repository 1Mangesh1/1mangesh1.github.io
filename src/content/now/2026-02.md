February has been one of the most productive months in recent memory. The kind where you look back and genuinely feel like things moved forward.

## Personal Site Overhaul

The biggest project this month has been a massive overhaul of this very site. I've written 20 new blog post drafts covering everything from Docker multi-stage builds to Cloudflare Workers to CSS architecture patterns. The content pipeline is flowing — now it's about editing, polishing, and shipping. I've also added new content collections for bookmarks, code snippets, and a reading list. The site is evolving from a simple blog into a proper digital garden.

## Deep Into Rust and WebAssembly

Rust has been clicking in a way it hasn't before. I'm building small CLI tools to solidify my understanding — a markdown link checker, a git stats tool, and a file organizer. The borrow checker and I have reached a truce. WebAssembly is the natural next step, and I'm exploring using Rust-compiled WASM modules for performance-critical parts of web apps.

## Edge Computing with Cloudflare Workers

I've been experimenting with Cloudflare Workers for API proxying, image optimization, and A/B testing at the edge. The developer experience is surprisingly good, and the performance gains from running logic closer to the user are real and measurable.

## Engineering Management Reading

*The Manager's Path* by Camille Fournier is excellent — practical, honest, and structured. *Build* by Tony Fadell is more about product thinking but has great insights on leading engineering teams. Both are shaping how I think about the next phase of my career.

## DevPulse Dashboard

The side project I'm most excited about. DevPulse is a developer productivity dashboard that aggregates data from GitHub, Jira, and CI/CD pipelines into a single view. Still early days, but the architecture is coming together nicely with a Rust backend and a React frontend.
