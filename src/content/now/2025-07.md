🏢 **Role**: Building RESTful APIs for mobile apps at work — focusing on clean, robust, and scalable backend services.

🛠️ **Hobby**: Developing a resume analyzer powered by the Google Gemini API — parsing resumes, matching against job descriptions, and generating feedback. Gemini's multimodal, prompt‑engineering capabilities are proving solid for automating ATS‑style resume reviews.

🧠 **Learning**: Deep into system design — tackling distributed architectures, microservices patterns, and scalability fundamentals.

📺 **Watching**: Still hooked on Ryan Trahan's content. He's currently doing the "50 States in 50 Days" Airbnb fundraising challenge—daily vlogs, one-off personalities, big impact.

💭 **Mood**: Feeling the itch to wander. Constantly toggling between Pune and Mumbai this month.

📍 **Location**: Commuting between Mumbai ↔ Pune — shifting base for temporarily for projects and family.

✈️ **Travel**: Planning weekend trips between the two cities — exploring the hills, cafés, and refreshing city escapes.
