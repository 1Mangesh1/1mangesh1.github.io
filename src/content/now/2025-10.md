## What I'm up to right now

October has been a deep-dive month — focused on building infrastructure that scales. I've been hands-on with microservices, multi-tenant patterns, and writing about architecture challenges as I go.

I'm also experimenting with new code systems and project scaffolds to speed up development while keeping the structure clean and scalable.

## Projects

- **Microservices Work**: Designing and building modular backend services with clear ownership, using Django, and async messaging
- **Personal Site v2**: Rebuilding my site in Astro with a better content system, refined UI, and feature-rich markdown tooling
- **Resume Analyzer**: Experimenting with auth, credits, and LaTeX-based resume generation on a frontend-only MVP
- **Internal Docs**: Creating visual benchmarks and documentation flows in Notion and diagrams.net

## Reading

Finally picking up _The Fountainhead_ — not for the ideology, but for the creative rebellion and raw ambition. Also been revisiting some older architecture posts from Martin Fowler and Segment's engineering blog.

## Goals for October

1. Ship blog on API benchmarking for multi-tenant SaaS
2. Finalize service boundaries for resume analyzer backend
3. Keep refining personal brand and content funnel
4. Add auth workflows (JWT + refresh) into microservice stack

## Life updates

Settling into better workflows — both in code and in life. A lot more thinking in terms of systems, ownership, and design clarity.
Also finally took time to upgrade my home setup and started blocking focus time more strictly. It's helping a lot.
