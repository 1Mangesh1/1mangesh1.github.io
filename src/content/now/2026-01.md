## What I'm up to right now

New year, fresh start! January 2026 is all about building on the momentum from 2025 while exploring new territories. After spending the last few months deep in system design and microservices, I'm now channeling that energy into **AI agents and practical LLM applications**.

## Focus Areas

### AI Agents
The hot topic entering 2026. Moving beyond simple chatbots to explore:
- Autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute
- Tool-calling and function execution patterns
- Multi-step reasoning and memory systems
- Building agents that actually work in production

### Continued System Design
Not abandoning the fundamentals - still going through advanced patterns:
- Distributed consensus and coordination
- Event sourcing and CQRS
- Real-world scalability case studies

## Projects

- **AI Agent Experiments**: Building small, practical AI agents to understand the patterns and pitfalls
- **Portfolio Updates**: Adding new content sections and polishing the site for 2026
- **Writing**: Planning to publish more consistently this year, starting with an AI agents guide

## Reading

Still working through _The Fountainhead_ - it's a long one! Also diving into AI/ML papers and technical blogs to stay current with the rapidly evolving landscape.

## Goals for January

1. Finish at least one AI agent prototype
2. Complete The Fountainhead (finally!)
3. Publish 1-2 blog posts
4. Set up a better system for tracking learning notes
5. Plan out major projects for Q1 2026

## Reflections

2025 was a great year - rebuilt the portfolio, wrote more than ever, and grew a lot professionally. Heading into 2026, I want to:
- Be more consistent with output
- Build things that are actually useful
- Share more of the learning journey
- Stay curious and keep experimenting

Let's see what this year brings!
