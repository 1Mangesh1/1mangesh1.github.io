## What I'm up to right now

This month has been all about rebuilding my personal site with Astro and diving deeper into modern web development practices. I'm particularly excited about the performance benefits and developer experience that Astro provides.

## Projects

- **Portfolio Rebuild**: Migrating from Hugo to Astro for better performance and easier content management
- **API Development**: Working on a Django REST API for a side project
- **Learning**: Exploring advanced TypeScript patterns and modern CSS techniques

## Reading

Currently making my way through "Eat that frog" - it's amazing how good the book is.

## Goals for next month

1. Complete the portfolio migration
2. Launch the first version of my new API project
3. Write more technical blog posts
4. Contribute to open source projects

## Life updates

Working from home has been great for productivity. I've set up a better workspace and established a solid routine that includes regular breaks.

The tech community at work has been incredibly welcoming, and I'm looking forward to learning more and contributing to the team.
