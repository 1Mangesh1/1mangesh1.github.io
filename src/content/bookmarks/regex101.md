Essential features:

- Real-time pattern testing
- Detailed explanation of each regex part
- Match information with capture groups
- Code generation for multiple languages
- Pattern library for common use cases

I keep this open whenever I'm writing regex. The explanations have taught me more about regex than any tutorial.
