The official Astro docs are incredibly well-written. Key sections I reference often:

- **Content Collections** - Type-safe content management
- **View Transitions** - SPA-like navigation
- **Islands Architecture** - Partial hydration explained
- **Integrations** - Adding React, Vue, Tailwind, etc.

The examples are practical and the API reference is comprehensive.
