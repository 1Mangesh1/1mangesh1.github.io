            Hi, I'm Mangesh! A passionate developer who loves creating innovative solutions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I'm a software developer with expertise in Python, Django, TensorFlow, and web development. 
            I enjoy working on machine learning projects, building web applications, and sharing my 
            knowledge through blogging.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My coding journey started with curiosity about how video games work. Since then, I've been 
        constantly learning and building projects that solve real-world problems. I began as a self-taught programmer, 
        then pursued formal education to deepen my foundations in computer science and software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I've worked on diverse projects ranging from simple web applications to complex machine learning systems. 
        Each project has taught me valuable lessons about code quality, performance optimization, and user experience. 
        I'm passionate about building software that not only works but also provides real value to users.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🚀 Build scalable web applications with modern frameworks (Django, React, Astro)</li>
        <li>🤖 Develop machine learning solutions using TensorFlow and other frameworks</li>
        <li>📝 Write technical blogs and tutorials to help other developers grow</li>
        <li>🎯 Create tools and utilities that automate workflows and solve real problems</li>
        <li>🔧 Help teams optimize code quality, performance, and deployment pipelines</li>
        <li>📚 Speak at tech meetups and conferences about software development best practices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Approach to Development</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that's easy for other developers to understand and build upon. 
        I'm a strong advocate for testing, documentation, and continuous learning. I prefer solutions that are simple yet elegant, 
        and I always consider performance and scalability from the ground up.
      </p>
